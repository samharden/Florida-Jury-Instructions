Who are the people here and what do they do? 
Judge/Court: I am the Judge. You may hear people occasionally refer to me as “The Court.” That is the formal name for my role. My job is to maintain order and decide how to apply the rules of the law to the trial. I will also explain various rules to you that you will need to know in order to do your job as the jury. It is my job to remain neutral on the issues of this lawsuit. 
Parties: A party who files a lawsuit is called the Plaintiff. A party that is sued is called the Defendant.
Attorneys: The attorneys have the job of representing their clients. That means they speak for their client here at the trial. They have taken oaths as attorneys to do their best and to follow the rules for their profession. 
Plaintiff’s Counsel: The attorney on this side of the courtroom, (introduce by name), represents (client name) and is the person who filed the lawsuit here at the courthouse. [His] [Her] job is to present [his] [her] client’s side of things to you. [He] [She] and [his] [her] client will be referred to most of the time as “the plaintiff.” (Attorney name), will you please introduce who is sitting at the table with you?
[Plaintiff without Counsel: (Introduce claimant by name), on this side of the courtroom, is the person who filed the lawsuit at the courthouse. (Claimant) is not represented by an attorney and will present [his] [her] side of things to you [himself] [herself]].

[Defendant’s Counsel: The attorney on this side of the courtroom, (introduce by name), represents (client name), the one who has been sued. [His] [Her] job is to present [his] [her] client’s side of things to you.

*Use the bracketed paragraph above when the case involves an uninsured or underinsured motorist carrier.

Court Clerk: This person sitting in front of me, (name), is the court clerk. [He] [She] is here to assist me with some of the mechanics of the trial process, including the numbering and collection of the exhibits that are introduced in the course of the trial. 
Court Reporter: The person sitting at the stenographic machine, (name), is the court reporter. [His] [Her] job is to keep an accurate legal record of everything we say and do during this trial. 
Bailiff: The person over there, (name), is the bailiff. [His] [Her] job is to maintain order and security in the courtroom. The bailiff is also my representative to the jury. Anything you need or any problems that come up for you during the course of the trial should be brought to [him] [her]. However, the bailiff cannot answer any of your questions about the case. Only I can do that.
Jury: Last, but not least, is the jury, which we will begin to select in a few moments from among all of you. The jury’s job will be to decide what the facts are and what the facts mean. Jurors should be as neutral as possible at this point and have no fixed opinion about the lawsuit. 
In order to have a fair and lawful trial, there are rules that all jurors must follow. A basic rule is that jurors must decide the case only on the evidence presented in the courtroom. You must not communicate with anyone, including friends and family members, about this case, the people and places involved, or your jury service. You must not disclose your thoughts about this case or ask for advice on how to decide this case.  
I want to stress that this rule means you must not use electronic devices or computers to communicate about this case, including tweeting, texting, blogging, e-mailing, posting information on a website or chat room, or any other means at all. Do not send or accept any messages to or from anyone about this case or your jury service.  
You must not do any research or look up words, names, [maps], or anything else that may have anything to do with this case. This includes reading newspapers, watching television or using a computer, cell phone, the Internet, any electronic device, or any other means at all, to get information related to this case or the people and places involved in this case. This applies whether you are in the courthouse, at home, or anywhere else. 
Many of you may have cell phones, tablets, laptops or other electronic devices with you here in the courtroom.** 

**The trial judge should select one of the following two alternative instructions explaining the rules governing jurors’ use of electronic devices, as explained in Note on Use 1. 
Alternative A:  [All cell phones, computers, tablets or other types of electronic devices must be turned off while you are in the courtroom.  Turned off means that the phone or other electronic device is actually off and not in a silent or vibrating mode.  You may use these devices during recesses, but even then you may not use your cell phone or electronic device to find out any information about the case or communicate with anyone about the case or the people involved in the case.  Do not take photographs, video recordings or audio recordings of the proceedings or of your fellow jurors.  After each recess, please double check to make sure your cell phone or electronic device is turned off.  At the end of the case, while you are deliberating, you must not communicate with anyone outside the jury room.  You cannot have in the jury room any cell phones, computers, or other electronic devices.  If someone needs to contact you in an emergency, the court can receive messages and deliver them to you without delay.  A contact phone number will be provided to you.]
Alternative B: [You cannot have any cell phones, tablets, laptops, or other electronic devices in the courtroom.  You may use these devices during recesses, but even then you may not use your cell phone or electronic device to find out any information about the case or communicate with anyone about the case or the people involved in the case.  Do not take photographs, video recordings or audio recordings of the proceedings or your fellow jurors.  At the end of the case, while you are deliberating, you must not communicate with anyone outside the jury room.  If someone needs to contact you in an emergency, the court can receive messages and deliver them to you without delay.  A contact phone number will be provided to you.]
What are the reasons for these rules?  These rules are imposed because jurors must decide the case without distraction and only on the evidence presented in the courtroom.  If you investigate, research, or make inquiries on your own outside of the courtroom, the trial judge has no way to make sure that the information you obtain is proper for the case.  The parties likewise have no opportunity to dispute or challenge the accuracy of what you find. That is contrary to our judicial system, which assures every party the right to ask questions about and challenge the evidence being considered against it and to present argument with respect to that evidence.  Any independent investigation by a juror unfairly and improperly prevents the parties from having that opportunity our judicial system promises.
Any juror who violates these restrictions jeopardizes the fairness of these proceedings, and a mistrial could result that would require the entire trial process to start over. A mistrial is a tremendous expense and inconvenience to the parties, the court, and the taxpayers.  If you violate these rules, you may be held in contempt of court, and face sanctions, such as serving time in jail, paying a fine or both.  
All of your communications with courtroom personnel, or me, will be part of the record of these proceedings.  That means those communications shall either be made in open court with the court reporter present or, if they are in writing, the writing will be filed with the court clerk.  I have instructed the courtroom personnel that any communications you have with them outside of my presence must be reported to me, and I will tell the parties [and their attorneys] about any communication from you that I believe may be of interest to the parties [and their attorneys].
However, you may communicate directly with courtroom personnel about matters concerning your comfort and safety, such as [juror parking] [location of break areas] [how and when to assemble for duty] [dress] [what personal items can be brought into the courthouse or jury room] [list any other types of routine ex parte communications permitted].
If you become aware of any violation of these instructions or any other instruction I give in this case, you must tell me by giving a note to the bailiff.
