(Prior to Voir Dire)

Welcome. [I] [The clerk] will now administer your oath.

Now that you have been sworn, I’d like to give you an idea about what we are here to do.

This is a civil trial. A civil trial is different from a criminal case, where a defendant is charged by the state prosecutor with committing a crime. The subject of a civil trial is a disagreement between people or companies [or others, as appropriate], where the claims of one or more of these parties have been brought to court to be resolved. It is called “a trial of a lawsuit.”

This is a case about (insert brief description of claim(s) and defense(s) brought to trial in this case).*
