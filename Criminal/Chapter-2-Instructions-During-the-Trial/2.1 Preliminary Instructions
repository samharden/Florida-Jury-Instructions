Ladies and gentlemen of the jury:
You have been selected and sworn as the jury to try the case of State of Florida v. (defendant).
This is a criminal case. (Defendant) is charged with (crime charged). The definition of the elements of (crime charged) will be explained to you later.
It is your solemn responsibility to determine if the State has proved its accusation beyond a reasonable doubt against (defendant). Your verdict must be based solely on the evidence, or lack of evidence, and the law.
The [information] [indictment] is not evidence and is not to be considered by you as any proof of guilt.
It is the judge's responsibility to decide which laws apply to this case and to explain those laws to you. It is your responsibility to decide what the facts of this case may be, and to apply the law to those facts. Thus, the province of the jury and the province of the court are well defined, and they do not overlap. This is one of the fundamental principles of our system of justice.
Before proceeding further, it will be helpful if you understand how a trial is conducted.
At the beginning of the trial, the attorneys will have an opportunity, if they wish, to make an opening statement. The opening statement gives the attorneys a chance to tell you what evidence they believe will be presented during the trial. What the lawyers say is not evidence, and you are not to consider it as such.
Following the opening statements, witnesses will be called to testify under oath. They will be examined and cross-examined by the attorneys. Documents and other exhibits also may be produced as evidence.
After the evidence has been presented, the attorneys will have the opportunity to make their final argument.
Following the arguments by the attorneys, the court will instruct you on the law applicable to the case.
After the instructions are given [the alternate juror will be released and] you will then retire to consider your verdict.
You should not form any definite or fixed opinion on the merits of the case until you have heard all the evidence, the argument of the lawyers and the instructions on the law by the judge. Until that time, you should not discuss the case among yourselves.
I now instruct you not to communicate with anyone, including your fellow jurors, about this case. No communication includes no e-mailing, text messaging, tweeting, blogging, or any other form of communication. You cannot do any research about the case or look up any information about the case. If you become aware of any violation of any of these rules at all, notify court personnel of the violation.
During the course of the trial, the court may take recesses, and you will be permitted to separate and go about your personal affairs. During these recesses you must not discuss the case with anyone nor permit anyone to say anything to you or in your presence about the case. If anyone attempts to say anything to you or in your presence about this case, tell [him] [her] that you are on the jury trying the case and ask [him] [her] to stop. If [he] [she] persists, leave [him] [her] at once and immediately report the matter to the [court deputy] [bailiff], who will advise me. 
The trial judge should select one of the following two alternative instructions explaining the rules governing jurorsâ€™ use of electronic devices, as explained in the Comment section.   
	Alternative A:  All cell phones, computers, tablets or other types of electronic devices must be turned off while you are in the courtroom. Turned off means that the phone or other electronic device is actually off and not in a silent or vibrating mode. You may use these devices during recesses, but even then you may not use your cell phone or electronic device to find out any information about the case or communicate with anyone about the case or the people involved in the case. Do not take photographs, video recordings or audio recordings of the proceedings or of your fellow jurors. After each recess, please double check to make sure your cell phone or electronic device is turned off. At the end of the case, while you are deliberating, you must not communicate with anyone outside the jury room. You cannot have in the jury room any cell phones, computers, or other electronic devices. If someone needs to contact you in an emergency, the court can receive messages and deliver them to you without delay. A contact phone number will be provided to you.
Alternative B:  You cannot have any cell phones, tablets, laptops, or other electronic devices in the courtroom.  You may use these devices during recesses, but even then you may not use your cell phone or electronic device to find out any information about the case or communicate with anyone about the case or the people involved in the case.  Do not take photographs, video recordings or audio recordings of the proceedings or your fellow jurors.  At the end of the case, while you are deliberating, you must not communicate with anyone outside the jury room.  If someone needs to contact you in an emergency, the court can receive messages and deliver them to you without delay.  A contact phone number will be provided to you.
The case must be tried by you only on the evidence presented during the trial in your presence and in the presence of the defendant, the attorneys and the judge. Jurors must not conduct any investigation of their own. This includes reading newspapers, watching television or using a computer, cell phone, the Internet, any electronic device, or any other means at all, to get information related to this case or the people and places involved in this case. This applies whether you are in the courthouse, at home, or anywhere else.  You must not visit places mentioned in the trial or use the Internet to look at maps or pictures to see any place discussed during the trial.
Jurors must not have discussions of any sort with friends or family members about the case or the people and places involved.  So, do not let even the closest family members make comments to you or ask questions about the trial. In this age of electronic communication, I want to stress again that just as you must not talk about this case face-to-face, you must not talk about this case by using an electronic device.  You must not use phones, computers or other electronic devices to communicate.  Do not send or accept any messages related to this case or your jury service.  Do not discuss this case or ask for advice by any means at all, including posting information on an Internet website, chat room or blog. 
What are the reasons for these rules? These rules are imposed because jurors must decide the case without distraction and only on the evidence presented in the courtroom. If you investigate, research, or make inquiries on your own, the trial judge has no way to make sure that the information you obtain is proper for the case. The parties likewise have no opportunity to dispute or challenge the accuracy of what you find. That is contrary to our judicial system, which assures every party the right to ask questions about and challenge the evidence being considered against it and to present argument with respect to that evidence. Any independent investigation by a juror unfairly and improperly prevents the parties from having that opportunity our judicial system promises.
Any juror who violates these restrictions jeopardizes the fairness of these proceedings and a mistrial could result that would require the entire trial process to start over. A mistrial is a tremendous expense and inconvenience to the parties, the court, and the taxpayers.  If you violate these rules, you may be held in contempt of court, and face sanctions, such as serving time in jail, paying a fine or both. 
Give if defendant requests.
	In every criminal proceeding a defendant has the absolute right to remain silent. At no time is it the duty of a defendant to prove [his] [her] innocence. From the exercise of a defendant's right to remain silent, a jury is not permitted to draw any inference of guilt, and the fact that a defendant did not take the witness stand must not influence your verdict in any manner whatsoever.
The attorneys are trained in the rules of evidence and trial procedure, and it is their duty to make all objections they feel are proper. When an objection is made you should not speculate on the reason why it is made; likewise, when an objection is sustained, or upheld, by me, you must not speculate on what might have occurred had the objection not been sustained, nor what a witness might have said had [he] [she] been permitted to answer.
During the trial, it may be necessary to confer with the attorneys out of your hearing to discuss matters of law and other matters that require consideration by me alone. It is impossible to predict when such a conference may be required or how long it will last. When such conferences occur, they will be conducted so as to consume as little of your time as is necessary for a fair and orderly trial of the case.
